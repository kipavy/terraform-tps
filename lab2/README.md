Lab 2:
Re-use the code from Lab 1
Variabilize your code to make the following parameters configurable:
Image to use
Container memory
Priviledged or not
Number of containers to spawn (container names to generate)
Port to use as starting point (i.e: if defined as 3000, the first container should be reachable on 3000, the next one on 3001, then 3002…)
Turn your terraform code into a terraform module that you will commit on a github repository
Pair with a classmate, create a new repository and try to use the module created by them by referencing it from GitHub
